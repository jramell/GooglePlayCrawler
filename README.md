# Simple Google Play Crawler

This simple crawler extracts the title, link, average rating, number of ratings, number of 5-star ratings and number of 4-star ratings for the top free music and audio apps in Google Play. Then, it writes that information to an Excel file so it can be analyzed more easily. 

## How To Run

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and run the main in src/Crawler.java

## Additional Notes
I made this crawler while I was making an Android application to help local music fans discover local musicians as a university project. It was a useful analysis tool at that moment, but it might stop working sometime in the future. If it does and I haven't noticed, please tell me by emailing me at sergiomaderarangel@gmail.com so I can do something about it.
